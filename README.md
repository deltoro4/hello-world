New to this
I'm very new to coding and programming itself. I've always wanted to learn how to do it, but never actually pursued it. Recently, I've heard of a website called "codecademy" and have been taking lessons on HTML. It seems pretty simple, but I want to expand my knownledge and ability. So, now I'm on github and trying to learn a couple of new things.
